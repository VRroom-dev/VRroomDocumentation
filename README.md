# VRroom Design & Documentation
### Design Document is located [[Overview|here]]

### this is meant to be viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

#### you will also need the Excalidraw plugin for some parts aswell

VRroom is the current working title of the game.
this will likely be changed at a later point when a better one is thought of.

TODO: add guidelines for how documentation should be structured and created.

if you have a idea or want to plan something out and want to quickly note it down stick it in Idea Dump and sort it later.
