# VRroom Design & Documentation

### this is meant to be viewed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)<br/>
you will also need the Excalidraw plugin for some parts aswell<br/>
<br/>

### Design Document is located [[Overview|here]]

VRroom is the current working title of the game.<br/>
this will likely be changed at a later point when a better one is thought of.

TODO: add guidelines for how documentation should be structured and created.

if you have a idea or want to plan something out and want to quickly note it down stick it in Idea Dump and sort it later.
