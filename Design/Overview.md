# Philosophy
The game will have minimal built-in functionality, but it will be extensible by the user.
The game must provide the required functionality for the user to extend it without resorting to jank or hacks.

# Hard Requirements
- The client and SDK must be open sourced.
- The game server must be able to be ran by any user.
- The SDK must be able to fully test everything in editor.
- The SDK will have minimal core components with extra functionality provided as scripts ran through the scripting system.
