Instances considered public are the public and friends+ types.
In publics any 18+ avatar should display your selected fallback avatar including on local client.
Fallback avatars are prohibited from being marked 18+.
18+ props are prohibited from being spawned in public instances.
18+ worlds can never be a public instance.
Unmarked 18+ content in publics should always be moderated no matter what.

It should be handled this way otherwise the game while have a very degraded experience for anyone unable to access 18+ content. the handling of avatars incentivizes people to avoid 18+ avatars in publics and it they don't the experience will still not be degraded majorly on one side by a blocked avatar.
